# Digit Recognition System

Digit Recognition System is a machine learning project that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It employs popular machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## Installation

To use the Digit Recognition System project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/digit-recognition-system.git`
2. Create a virtual environment for the project using `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
4. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the Digit Recognition System project, follow these steps:

1. Open the command line interface and navigate to the project directory.
2. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
3. Start the application by running `python main.py`.
4. Enter the path to an image of a handwritten digit when prompted.
5. The application will display the predicted digit.
